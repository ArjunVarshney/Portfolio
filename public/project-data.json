Leveraging features like age, BMI, number of children, region, and smoking habits, this model assesses the expected medical expenditure. By training on a dataset encompassing diverse individual profiles and their corresponding medical insurance costs, the model learns relationships between these variables to deliver precise predictions. Linear Regression serves as the core algorithm, employing a linear approach to comprehend the relationship between the input features and the medical expenditure. ",
